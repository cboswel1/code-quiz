We need a page with a highscore link, timer, and quiz interface. 

Highscore link 
    - The highscore link will link to a page that displays a collection of highscore 

Timer 
    -Once the user begins the each question, the timer will begin to countdown from 10. If the timer reaches 0, it skips to the next question. 

Quiz Interface 
    -We need a display that asks a user to begin the quiz, this page will also let the user know the number of points awarded for correct answer.
    - Once the user begins the quiz, they will be given a new display that has a question and 4 possible answers. Each correct answer should award a 
    set number of points. Each incorrect answer should prompt a "wrong" response to the page for a period of time. 
    - The quiz box should refresh to a new set of questions. 

After all questions are answered 
    -Once all questions are answered, user should be brought to a screen that displays their total number of points based on correct answers.
